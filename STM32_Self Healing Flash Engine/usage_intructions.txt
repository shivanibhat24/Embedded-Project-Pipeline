1. Hardware Setup:
   - Connect STM32 Nucleo F411RE to PC via USB
   - LED on PA5 will indicate system activity
   - User button on PC13 for manual triggers (if needed)
   - UART2 (PA2/PA3) connected via ST-Link for logging

2. Software Setup:
   - Import project into STM32CubeIDE
   - Ensure HAL and LL drivers are included
   - Build and flash to the board

3. Operation:
   - System boots and initializes flash integrity engine
   - Continuously monitors flash blocks every 5 seconds
   - Logs status via UART (115200 baud)
   - Automatically repairs corrupted blocks from backup area
   - LED toggles to indicate activity

4. Testing Corruption:
   - Use debugger to manually corrupt flash areas
   - Observe automatic detection and repair
   - Monitor UART output for detailed status

5. Flash Memory Layout:
   - 0x08000000-0x08020000: Bootloader/main firmware
   - 0x08020000-0x08040000: Primary data blocks (8x16KB)
   - 0x08040000-0x08060000: Backup data blocks (8x16KB)
   - 0x08060000-0x08070000: CRC lookup table
   - 0x08070000-0x08080000: Status logs
